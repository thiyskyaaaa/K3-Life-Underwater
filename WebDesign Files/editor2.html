				<h2>Template CSS (style.css) and Navigation Bar</h2>

                    which includes a common background image and CSS elements
                    such as the font style and padding for the website.

                    Additonally, created the header of the website, which consists of a navigation 
                    list which has a link to every page made by each team member, as well as a 
                    footer where each member can link their page editor and add their names.

                    <div class="file-links">
                        <a href="style.html"><strong>Link to Sample Template with Navigation bar</strong></a>

                    <br><br>
                    Used image maps and JavaScript to ensure the images tied to each content page
                    is clickable at all times.

                    Used the CSS flex-wrap property to display the images in a grid-like style.
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="file-links">
